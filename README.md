# oskhen-sorting
A collection of sorting algorithms

## Python

### Tests
Navigate to the `pyimpl` folder and either run the test with `pytest` or simply run the `sort_test.py` file.

### Visualization
For visualization, run `visualization.py -h` for directions.

To install all requirements, run ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt``` or similar command. 
Requires `ffmpeg` as a command-line utilty, which most likely means that it doesn't support windows (at least not natively)
